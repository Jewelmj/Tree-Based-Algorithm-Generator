Note: for running this application, you have to run the gui_maker.py file. and the input file is input.txt.

About: This project implements an algorithm that converts a user-provided text file into a tree-like structure of functions. Each word in the file represents a function, and spaces denote nested functions, creating a hierarchical relationship. The algorithm processes the text to generate and visualize a structured representation of functions.

Ideation: Programming can be repetative and a easy way to generate code is woulld be realy helpful.

Time of devolopment: during my second year of B-tech, 2023.

Pros: Helps speed up devolopment for programmers.

Cons: The code used for generating code is hard to read and modify.
